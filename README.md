# DEAssignmnent2
This is a Data Engineering Assignment 2 at JADS

The goal of this assignment is to design and implement data architectures and data processing pipelines using Apache Spark and GCP services.

Some part of the architecture is done in Virtal Machine in Google Cloud. Because of budget limitations, every time you restart the virtual machine you need to enter a new IP address. 

Docker and docker compose must be installed.
